# Segmentation and Classification of Mammographic Images
### This is our workspace during the experimental research process for the topic 'Deep Learning Techniques for Segmenting Breast Lesion Regions and Classifying Mammography Images.'

```
Note: We process data on a local machine and train on Kaggle using free GPUs.
```

### Workflow
- We conducted data processing for the CIBS-DDSM dataset in the files ***main_train_cibs_ddsm*** and ***main_test_cibs_ddsm***, and for the DDSM dataset in the file ***processing_data***.
- The ***Train model*** folder contains files used for model training.
